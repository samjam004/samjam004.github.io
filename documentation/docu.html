					What is Laning in League?
				</header>
				<p>
					Laning is the beginning phase of the game
					where you last hit creeps, "trade" with your
					opponent, and secure early game objectives 
					with your team.
					<br><br>
					Good laners will easily outshine anyone lacking 
					in this fundamental skill of the game even if 
					they're superior at teamfighting or dueling. 
				</p>
				<p>Laning can take years to become proficient in,
				   even the professionals train everyday to perfect the 
				   craft. Therefore, it's important to begin learning by 
				   forming some good habbits listed in this documentation.

					Farming
				</header>
				<p>
					Last hitting minions to get gold is a no brainer.
					You need gold to buy items so you may slay and push 
					past your foes in order to win the game.
					<br><br>
					But if it was that simple, then why is the average 
					silver player farming only 5 creeps per minute?
					<img src="maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Laning Example" width="600px" height="400px">
				</p>
				<p>
					The reason for this is usually lack of focus. There
					are a lot of things that are worthy of focus
					while laning, and farming with precision must be an 
					unconcious habit, a second nature. 
					<br><br>
					Once a player gains a creep score (cs) lead of 2 waves,
					he can reset and surprise his oponnent with an extra
					powerful item component and go for a solo kill.
					<br><br>
					One solo kill will snowball into plates, and more farm.
					In high level play, one mistake will destroy your tempo
					and cost you or your oponnent everything
					<br><br>
					Farming well is easily the most consistent way of winning
					games.

					Trading
				</header>
				<p>
					Trading simply means exchanging blows with
					your oponent through abilities or auto
					attacks.
					<br><br>
					This is key to getting "prio" or priority
					over your lane, forcing your oponennt to 
					let you farm, give you first roam, or 
					concede farm themselves in order to not 
					lose a favorable amount of health.


				</p>
				<p>
					Trading consists of short trades and 
					"all-ins." 
					<br><br>
					The former is usualy weaved inbetween minion last 
					hits at the exact moment your adversary is in his 
					auto attack animation when last hitting. This forces 
					them to continuously decide wether they want to trade 
					back with you or give up the cs. Usually this type
					of trade will end with one or two exchanges of abilities,
					unless one player senses kill potential.
					<br><br>
					All-inning is when you realise there is the potential
					to kill your oponnent, then charging them down with
					your auto attacks and abilities.
					<br><br>
					You don't want to always all-in, though, because minions do
					a considerable amount of damage in the early and mid game.
					So, if you fight in an army of enemy minions all of the 
					time, you'll surely start to lose your trades if the 
					enemy responds to your aggresion by just walking away into 
					the wave.

					Objectives
				</header>
				<p>
					There are 3 main objectives that you should plan ahead for when 
					laning: the dragon, herald, and scuttle crab. 
					<br><br>
					You should attempt to "shove out" or clear a wave 30 seconds before 
					one of these objectives are spawning if your team is in a good
					position to contest them. This is to gain prio over your lane 
					and give you the first move to the objective, increasing the man
					power of your team before the enemy laner can match you. 
					<br><br>
					If you have a lot of gold in your pockets or can purchase a key 
					item component, it's strongly recommended that you recall 45 seconds
					in advance to visit the shop while still showing up on time.
				</p>

				<p>While scuttle crabs aren't real objectives, they're very important to 
					your jungler since they give a lot of gold while providing perpetual
					vision in a key portion of the map. Good laners will take the same 
					precautions for scuttle crabs as they do for dragons and heralds.
					<br><br>
					If you make the effort in supporting your jungler, they will likely
					become more influential in the game which will certainly help your
					team in the long run. They'll also appreciate it very much :)
				</p>

					Roaming
				</header>

				<p>
					Roaming is an advanced tactic that is similar in 
					roaming for objectives except it's more focused around
					getting kills for yourself or your team.
				</p>

				<p>
					This can occur at anytime, though, since depends heavily on
					the wave states of other lanes.
					<br>
					<br>
					For example, when you recall for an item, the enemies have 
					zero idea where you will walk from base, so if top lane is pushed
					up your could make a roam into top river and potential find 
					yourself or your top laner a valuable kill. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Or if you shove out your top lane and have nothing to do but enemy mid 
					laner is low health under tower, you could roam down and potentially go
					for the dive.
					<div>

					</div>
					
					In this picture, you can see the supports going for an example gank mid after their
					first recall. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Be careful though, as if these roams go wrong you could end up losing your 
					own lane! Your oponnent usually won't be asleep and will be either rushing down
					your tower or be right on your tail to clean up if you get too low or the play
					goes bad.
